# DALI.Website2

This is my second attempt at making my own website. 

This version is more structured with better Bootstrap implementation, better code organization, and just a more structured website 
overall. 

Due to having used my one free namecheap domain, I was unable to get another domain for this website. So, in order to view the 
final product, please download the homepage html file and open it on chrome to view. 

This website shows the growth in my coding abilities since the last website I made. I hope to continue exploring languages and eventually
utilizing APIs for other code projects.
